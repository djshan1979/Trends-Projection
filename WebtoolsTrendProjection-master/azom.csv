The self-life of bakery products is determined by the type of ingredients used and the packaging conditions. Without antimicrobial preservatives and extra packaging technologies (modified environment packaging or cleanroom technology), bread has a shelf life of around 2–3 days.', 'It has been demonstrated that the majority of microbiological deterioration of bakery items is caused by molds such as penicillium spp. and aspergillus niger. Molds are responsible for generating off-flavors, and the production of mycotoxins and allergic chemicals. Visible yeast growth (chalk molds) is also a significant reason for bread damage.', 'Consumers expect bakery items to have a longer shelf life and be free of synthetic preservatives. This is accomplished by using modified atmosphere (MA) packing. The MA is mainly composed of N2 and CO2 atmosphere. CO2 and N2 in MA are antibacterial and reduce microbial growth.', 'MA packaging can minimize the amount of oxygen in the headspace, which is required for aerobic microbe growth in bread. However, MA packaging may be unable to lower oxygen concentrations to deficient levels on an industrial scale. Innovative packaging technologies (oxygen scavengers and MA packaging) can reduce residual oxygen in the headspace, extending the shelf life of bakery items and obviating the need for antimicrobial preservatives.', 'In this study, researchers investigated the application of the proposed palladium-based catalytic system for oxygen removal and its effect on mold formation on par-baked buns, toast bread slices, and gluten-free bread slices.', 'Experimental set-up to evaluate the influence of palladium-based oxygen scavenger on the mold free shelf life of bakery products.

It was ensured that the active side of the CSP was directed toward the headspace of the bakery item package, away from the packed food.\xa0', 'To obtain sporulation, aspergillus niger (ATCC 16404) was cultivated on malt agar plates made of malt extract and agar for 12 days at 25 °C in the darkroom.', 'For the study, the researchers used par-baked buns, toast bread, and par-baked gluten-free bread. Par-baked buns were produced with wheat flour, tap water, margarine, backing agent, salt, and yeast. Toast bread was produced with wheat flour using tap water, backing agent, salt, rapeseed oil, and yeast. Par-baked buns and toast bread were defrosted at 5 °C for 24 hours before packaging. Post preparation of par-baked buns and toast bread was packed in bakery-type packaging.

After 2–3 days, mold development was found on all products packed under standard atmosphere and MA without CO2, and CSP.', 'The addition of CO2 to MA increased the mold-free self-life (MFSL) by 8–10 days, 16–18 days, and 3–4 days, respectively, for par-baked buns, toast, and gluten-free bread. Within 105–190 minutes of using CSP with MA, the oxygen content in the headspace was reduced for all bread goods, resulting in an additional 3–9 days of MFSL for bakery products.', '', 'Change in headspace oxygen concentration of par-baked buns (a) and growth of spoilage molds on par-baked buns (b) packed under normal atmosphere (NA), modified atmosphere with 93\u2009vol.-% N2, 5\u2009vol.-% H2, 2\u2009vol.-%O2\xa0(MAP w/o CO2) or modified atmosphere with 93\u2009vol.-% CO2, 5\u2009vol.-% H2, 2\u2009vol.-%O2\xa0(MAP w CO2) with and without the catalytic system based on palladium (CSP) for 38 days at 25\u2009°C.

Additionally, the oxygen emitted by the product during storage and diffusion through the packing material must also be removed. Oxygen removal could be accomplished by combining the CSP with another oxygen scavenger system, which is capable of long-term oxygen absorption. Effective oxygen removal from bakery product packaging enables the elimination of antimicrobial preservatives and aids in the development of clean label products. However, additional expenditures involved with the employment of two oxygen scavengers are a considerable economical factor.', 'A similar analysis using spoilage yeasts which could still lead to spoilage of bakery products even with the application of oxygen exclusion technologies needs to be carried out in the future. In addition, a combined study can also be conducted using a variety of yeast and bacterial to understand the spoilage of other bakery products.', 'Nadine Rüegg, Bettina Röcker, Selçuk Yildirim, Application of palladium-based oxygen scavenger to extend the mold-free shelf life of bakery products, Food Packaging, and Shelf Life, Volume 31, 2022,100771,ISSN22142894,\xa0https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214289421001393?via%3Dihub', '\n\tDisclaimer: The views expressed here are those of the author expressed in their private capacity and do not necessarily represent the views of AZoM.com Limited T/A AZoNetwork the owner and operator of this website.

II: Ideal Freeze−Thaw Conditions. Image Credit:\xa0patchii/Shutterstock.com', 'One of the main problems in promoting food security and environmental sustainability is reducing food loss and waste. Heat abuse in the spectrum of 4.4-60 °C during perishable food storage is one of the key factors that jeopardize quality and food safety.', 'Because of its high latent heat of fusion at 0°C, traditional ice is often utilized as a food chilling medium in food supply chains. However, there are worries about microbiological cross-contamination from glacier meltwater.', 'Ice packs and novel forms of antibacterial ice have been produced and explored as viable substitutes, as stated in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry Engineering. Despite these efforts, a void for an optimal food coolant still exists.', 'JICs (jelly ice cubes) predicated on 10% gelatin hydrogels have been proposed and evaluated as a different type of reusable, biodegradable food coolant fluid that could actually prevent microbial cross-contamination by restricting the cooling water aspect within the hydrogel structures with zero-plastic components.', 'Nonetheless, there are two major issues that need to be addressed in order for JICs to be more feasible in food chilling applications.', 'To begin, the thermal characteristics of JICs must remain stable during repeated freeze-thaw cycles in order to accomplish the reusability attributes of the very minimal reduction in heat-absorption ability.', 'Second, hydrogel systems should be designed with strong mechanical characteristics to ensure that structural damages and material defects are minimized during the numerous phase transitions of water in the hydrogels throughout FT cycles.', 'The degree of physiochemical linking of gel polymer must be good to develop a strong system. To improve JIC stability, researchers must investigate the effects of preparation and practical cryogenic settings on the structures, characteristics, and functions of JICs.', 'Hydrogels are water-filled networks supported by a polymer matrix. Cryogels are hydrogels that have gone through several cycles of freezing, freeze storage, and thawing.', 'Water molecules in the hydrogel are categorized into three types based on interactions with natural protein\xa0polymers: freezable bound water, free water,\xa0and non-freezable bound water. When freezable water (both free water and freezable bound water) freezes, the phase transition causes possible disturbances or damages to the system.', 'Mastering the shape and size of the generated ice grains during freezing is a vital component in limiting the influence of the freeze-thaw process on the polymer network architectures.', 'By altering the nucleation rate, the freezing rate of water controls the size of the ice particles. Rapid freezing temperatures can probably be attributed to the prepping of JICs to reduce the usage of formed ice grains and the destructive impact of the phase transition of water on the polymer matrix systems, as influenced by the freeze-casting methodology in materials engineering and flash-freezing in food technology.', 'Meat and seafood storage conditions are also tuned to maintain the ideal food characteristics.', 'The influence of ice crystals on many systems has been studied in materials science. Ice-templating was widely utilized to generate diverse inorganic compounds with macro-, micro-, and mesoporosity by altering the chemical composition of the system and the freezing temperatures to modify the connection between the ice-fronting velocity and the critical velocity.', 'Controlling the freezing rate and pressure has a significant impact on the structure and function of the resultant materials, particularly aerogels, according to several studies.', 'The solidification and melting of water, on either hand, changed the water-protein relationships in the initial homogeneous hydrogel systems. With the tiniest levels of physical cross-linking inside the protein-polymer structure, the quick freezing and delayed thawing process reduced water loss.', 'JICs treated with Freeze-Thaw\xa0maintain the overall moisture content and freezable water content of the materials at a level similar to fresh JICs\xa0by reducing the creation of H-bonds and disulfide bonds inside the protein macro network, conserving the hydrophilicity of the materials and ensuring the cooling ability of JICs for 10 or more application cycles.\xa0', 'JICs, as a sort of innovative reusable and environmentally friendly cooling medium, should be resistant to the phase shift of water in hydrogel polymer matrices and provide constant cooling functions throughout time.', 'The considerable effect of ice grains generated during FT treatments on the structure and function of JICs was observed in previous work. Various FT parameters were thoroughly studied in this study in order to build a thin protein-polymer network by manipulating the ice grain production and fusing circumstances.', 'After many FT cycles, the combination of fast freezing and gradual thawing treatment conditions resulted in homogenous polymer network topologies.', 'The pattern discovered in the influence of freezing and thawing circumstances on the architectures and characteristics of hydrogels was consistent with previous research and might be used to guide the manufacture and use of JICs and other water-rich materials.', 'However, it should be emphasized that combining liquid nitrogen or dry ice and anhydrous ethanol in the creation of JICs in a quick freeze state may be only practicable for business users and out of reach for normal consumers. For the practical usage of such innovative cooling materials, a more convenient application process should be studied.', 'Zou, J. (2021).
