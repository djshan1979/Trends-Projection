The selflife of bakery products is determined by the type of ingredients used and the packaging conditions. Without antimicrobial preservatives and extra packaging technologies (modified environment packaging or cleanroom technology), bread has a shelf life of around  days.', 'It has been demonstrated that the majority of microbiological deterioration of bakery items is caused by molds such as penicillium spp. and aspergillus niger. Molds are responsible for generating offflavors, and the production of mycotoxins and allergic chemicals. Visible yeast growth (chalk molds) is also a significant reason for bread damage.', 'Consumers expect bakery items to have a longer shelf life and be free of synthetic preservatives. This is accomplished by using modified atmosphere (MA) packing. The MA is mainly composed of N and CO atmosphere. CO and N in MA are antibacterial and reduce microbial growth.', 'MA packaging can minimize the amount of oxygen in the headspace, which is required for aerobic microbe growth in bread. However, MA packaging may be unable to lower oxygen concentrations to deficient levels on an industrial scale. Innovative packaging technologies (oxygen scavengers and MA packaging) can reduce residual oxygen in the headspace, extending the shelf life of bakery items and obviating the need for antimicrobial preservatives.', 'In this study, researchers investigated the application of the proposed palladiumbased catalytic system for oxygen removal and its effect on mold formation on parbaked buns, toast bread slices, and glutenfree bread slices.', 'Experimental setup to evaluate the influence of palladiumbased oxygen scavenger on the mold free shelf life of bakery products.

Parbaked buns were produced with wheat flour, tap water, margarine, backing agent, salt, and yeast. Toast bread was produced with wheat flour using tap water, backing agent, salt, rapeseed oil, and yeast. Parbaked buns and toast bread were defrosted at  C for  hours before packaging.

Additionally, the oxygen emitted by the product during storage and diffusion through the packing material must also be removed. Oxygen removal could be accomplished by combining the CSP with another oxygen scavenger system, which is capable of longterm oxygen absorption. Effective oxygen removal from bakery product packaging enables the elimination of antimicrobial preservatives and aids in the development of clean label products. However, additional expenditures involved with the employment of two oxygen scavengers are a considerable economical factor.', 'A similar analysis using spoilage yeasts which could still lead to spoilage of bakery products even with the application of oxygen exclusion technologies needs to be carried out in the future. In addition, a combined study can also be conducted using a variety of yeast and bacterial to understand the spoilage of other bakery products.', 'Nadine Rüegg, Bettina Röcker, Selçuk Yildirim, Application of palladiumbased oxygen scavenger to extend the moldfree shelf life of bakery products, Food Packaging, and Shelf Life, Volume , ,,ISSN,\https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S?via%Dihub', 'Disclaimer: The views expressed here are those of the author expressed in their private capacity and do not necessarily represent the views of AZoM.com Limited T/A AZoNetwork the owner and operator of this website.

The research was published in the journal Coatings.', 'Petrochemical packaging materials which are widely used in the meat processing industry, take a long time to regenerate and biodegrade, thus they adversely affect the environment. Therefore, the necessity for the development of ecofriendly packaging materials for meat processing, which are easily degradable and recyclable, came to the fore, stated Professor KukHwan Seol lead author of the study.', 'Therefore, Seol and his team recently evaluated the feasibility of the role that edible films could play in today’s meat market and whether these films could have viable application towards the ‘green’ preservation of meat and meat products.\', 'Today’s consumers are more environmentally aware and therefore on the lookout for products that are more ecofriendly, including what types of packaging their products come in. Manufacturers and food producers are aware of this and are often launching new packaging designs to meet customer needs, however, the majority of packaging materials derive from petrochemicalbased plastics.', 'The majority of food packaging is designed to be singleuse and is typically thrown away, with just % of all global plastic waste being recycled.

Therefore, meat packaging should ensure the meat reaches the consumer in peak condition, offering the necessary antibacterial and antioxidant properties.', 'The development of edible films for food packaging is aimed at protecting food products from any kind of oxidization, microbial contamination, and physical/mechanical damage as well as addressing concerns around waste production.', 'The concept of edible films evolved from environmental concerns, the increasing burden of plastic waste disposal, utilization of food industrial waste and consumer demands of natural, nutritional and healthy foods', 'KukHwan Seol, Professor and Lead Author,\National Institute of Animal Science', 'Some edible films are produced using biopolymers, which have been regarded as potential replacements for petrochemicalbased materials. Edible films can be wrapped around meat products and act as a barrier against external elements, thereby protecting the product and potentially extending shelflife.', 'Producing edible films can be split up into two methods: dry and wet. The dry method is where heat is applied to edible and biodegradable materials to produce a form that can mold around the product: The thermoplastic properties of the raw materials should be identified in order to design edible film manufacturing processes, says Seol.', 'The wet process of edible film production uses solvents considered safe for consumption, such as water and ethanol, to dissolve filmforming materials into a solution. The solution is then applied to the surface or product ready for molding and subsequently dried to produce the protective film.', 'Common biopolymers used in these methods include starch, gum, cellulose, pectin, and alginate. Finding the blend of right materials is key and may include the use of milk proteins, plant proteins, and lipids to find the optimal packaging material.', 'Efforts are focused on developing the right combination of blended materials because the effectiveness of edible films for meat products depends on biopolymer types and bioactive compounds to enhance their functional properties', 'KukHwan Seol, Professor and Lead Author,\National Institute of Animal Science', 'So, while meat remains an important part of the modern diet and seems to be on the rise, it is crucial that alternative packaging materials are used to limit the environmental impact of the meat industry.', 'This is a crucial consideration given the current climate crisis and the fact world leaders are meeting this week in Glasgow at the United Nations’ COP conference on climate change.
